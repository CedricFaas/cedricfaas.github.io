I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at Saarland University and Research Assistant at the Computational Interactions Group (https://cix.cs.uni-saarland.de/) with a strong interest in human–computer interaction. My research explores how AI systems can support users in decision-making and work-related tasks. I focus particularly on designing user interfaces that keep users engaged, motivated, and effectively in control when overseeing AI-systems.

I’m also interested in how users perceive their responsibility when making decisions with the assistance of AI, and how interface design can help align users’ beliefs with their actual roles and responsibilities.

With a dual academic background in Computer Science (BSc) and Philosophy (BA), I’m passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration and enjoy working at the intersection of Computer Science, Psychology, and Philosophy to address complex questions about technology and human agency.
